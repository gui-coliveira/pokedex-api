#### Pokédex made using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co)


This is a consumption-only API — only the HTTP GET method is available on resources.

No authentication is required to access this API, and all resources are fully open and available. Since the move to static hosting in November 2018, rate limiting has been removed entirely, but we still encourage you to limit the frequency of requests to limit our hosting costs.
